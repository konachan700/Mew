### What is it? 
It's a small USB devise for safety passwords storing. The device not require any driver on most popular desktop OSes, and compatable with Android OS. You do not need any special skills to use Mew.


### Why Opensource? Are not you afraid that Chinese manufacturers will steal the idea?
1. The closed-source device cannot be a secure, because it may contain a backdoor for the manufacturer, for hacker 
in the sales chain or for a government. Only open source device can be a trusted. <br>
2. No. I develop the device first of all for myself, for study STM32. Anybody can make Mew, but I do not give a guarantee that I will continue to support the device.


### Where I can buy Mew?
Currently nowhere. You can make Mew yourself. In future time, may be, I will selling Mew in a project website.
